# Hello, I'm Akshat 
I'm cloud solutions architect. I like crafting scalable, resilient, and secure cloud architecture that empower business to innovate and grow. 

I am looking for work and projects where I am able to apply my experience and knowledge and have opportunities to learn, develop and progress my career. I am naturally curious, confident, and perpetually working on improving my skills.
